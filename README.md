# xkcd
This is an attempt to create a local repository of all xkcd comics (other than interactive ones).
The python script traverses through all the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comics and, the images are dumped into the folder containing the script.

Requirements:
  1) python3
  2) bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
  3) sqlite3 ( to make the script restartable, i.e, pick up from where you left).

Updated to scrap and store all the images published till 26/06/2019.
